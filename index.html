//The beginning of my journey
<h1>This is my first Github website</1>

I'm a newbie and I knew this website by searching on the internet. It was very hard to understand all the function that github can provide but with the help of 
the internet, I was able to do so. My favourite programming languages are Python and Javasciprt. I am intending to learn CSS and SQL in the future. 




Thank you very much for reading this website.
